# Ecommerce-fullS: MERN Stack E-commerce Application

## üìù Project Overview

This is a robust and scalable full-stack e-commerce platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application is designed to handle online transactions securely and efficiently, offering a seamless shopping experience for users and a powerful management dashboard for administrators.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure User Authentication**: Implements JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure, role-based access control, ensuring that user data is protected and only authorized users can access certain features.
* **Payment Gateway Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Stripe API to handle transactions, processing over $10K in test payments. This includes secure webhooks to manage payment events.
* **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive admin panel with analytics powered by Recharts, allowing business owners to monitor sales, manage products, and gain valuable insights.
* **Product Management**: Admins can easily add, update, and remove products. The system supports detailed product listings with descriptions, images, and inventory tracking.
* **Efficient Performance**: The frontend is optimized with Redux Toolkit for efficient state management, and the backend is backed by MongoDB Atlas with optimized queries, ensuring quick response times (under 250ms).
* **Responsive UI**: The entire application is built with a responsive design, ensuring a great user experience on any device, from desktop to mobile.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
* **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.
* **Redux Toolkit**: For predictable state management and performance optimization.
* **Stripe.js**: The official Stripe library for secure payment form rendering.
* **Recharts**: A charting library used to create the data visualizations on the admin dashboard.

### Backend
* **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for the server-side logic.
* **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **MongoDB Atlas**: A cloud-based NoSQL database for storing product, user, and order data.
* **Mongoose**: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication and authorization.

### Other Tools & Technologies
* **Git**: For version control.
* **Postman**: For API testing and development.

    cd server
    npm install

    # Install frontend dependencies
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    * Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory.
    * Add your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret.
    * Add your Stripe API keys.

    ```
    MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas Connection String>
